# Simple Shell in C
Developed a Command Line Interface (CLI) application written in the C programming language, where commands are inputted via the keyboard and executed by the operating system. This shell supports three internal commands (cd, echo, pwd) and five external commands (ls, cat, date, rm, mkdir). The program was crafted using Virtual Box in conjunction with Artix Linux.
